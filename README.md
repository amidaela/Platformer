# Procedural and Adaptive Platformer – Maturitätsarbeit

This project is a game for my Maturaarbeit, a 2D platform game developed using the Godot Engine.
The work focuses on procedural level generation and adaptive enemy behavior that adjusts based on player performance.
The game features simple pixel-art graphics, level by level progression, and dynamic combat difficulty.
